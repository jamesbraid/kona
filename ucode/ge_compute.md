# What the geometry-engine routines compute

The per-label catalogue in [ge_handlers.md](ge_handlers.md) says where each label sits, what reaches it and which operations its words use. This page goes one step further for the routines an emulator needs first: what each one takes in, what it writes out and the arithmetic between them. Every entry was written after reading the routine's words in [ge_listing/](ge_listing/) (`ge.u`, IRIX 6.5.30m) with the operation codes of [ge_ops.md](ge_ops.md) and the field readings of [ge_isa.md](ge_isa.md).

Facts are labelled **established** (read from the words at the addresses given) or **inferred** (with the reasoning). The operation of a word is established when its code is one the diagnostic test fixes; how the two arithmetic units route their register operands (the decoded groups `r148`, `r128` and `r110`) is not mapped, so the order of terms inside a sum, and which partial sum a word extends, come from the memory addresses and offsets the words name, not from a register trace.

## Engine memory the transform code shares

**Established** from the stores of the load-matrix handlers (form-14 and form-5 words with `r211` = 3 and `r95` = 4, an immediate address, in `matrixfunc.S`) and from the form-5 reads with C = 0x1b and `r95` = 0x13 in the transform modules:

| Words | Contents | Writer |
|---|---|---|
| 0x1f-0x2e | inverse of the modelview, for normals | `mMatrixInverse` |
| 0x2f-0x3e | modelview matrix, 16 words in the order the host sends them | `mgeb_LoadMatrix_Modelview` (operand words 0-15) |
| 0x3f-0x4e | projection matrix | `mgeb_LoadMatrix_Projection` |
| 0x4f-0x5e | composite object-to-clip matrix | `uMatrixMultCCC` |
| 0x5f-0x6e | texture matrix | `mgeb_LoadMatrix_Texture` |
| 0xa3-0xba | six user clip planes in eye space, four words each | the clip-plane handler |
| 0x190-0x19f | colour matrix | `mgeb_LoadMatrix_Color` |

**Inferred:** the host sends a GL matrix column by column, so word 4j + i of each block is row i of column j. Every matrix handler also stores to special register 0x29 or 0x2b (B = 0x1c, E = 0x29 or 0x2b), and the transform modules start with conditional calls on `cc` 0x72 and 0x76 to the routines that rebuild the composite and the inverse: those two registers are the dirty flags the conditions test.

## Vertex records and the transform loop

**Established** from the words of `uxform.s`. Every transform module handles two vertices per pass. Address register 1 and 2 point at the two vertex records (loaded from registers 0x10 and 0x11 in the prologue), registers 3 and 4 trail them by one pass (copied from 1 and 2 halfway through the loop), and register 0x13 is added to registers 1 and 2 at the end of a pass to step both to the next pair. Register 0 is loaded from register 0x19 and stepped by F = 0x25, and the relative transfer at the end of the loop body (`cc` 0x11, condition group 7) repeats while it has not run out. Words of a vertex record, as the transform code reads and writes them through those registers:

| Offset | Contents |
|---|---|
| 0-3 | object position x, y, z, w (input) |
| 8-0xa | object normal (input) |
| 0xf-0x11 | eye-space normal (output of the normal transforms) |
| 0x13-0x16 | eye-space position (output of the eye transforms) |
| 0x17-0x1a | clip-space x, y, z, w (output of the clip transforms) |

## Transform modules (uxform.s)

- `mmo_ObjToClipSpace` (`uxform.s` lines 44-97): **inferred**, the plain vertex transform
  of the fixed-function path. It takes object positions (record words 0-3, two vertices per pass) and multiplies each by the
  composite matrix at engine words 0x4f-0x5e, four multiplies per input component, summed in two partial chains that the four
  plain adds at 0x123b-0x123e combine. The results are the clip-space x, y, z and w, stored back into the record at offsets
  0x17-0x1a. It then computes the six frustum distances w + x, w - x, w + y, w - y, w + z and w - z with unit-1 float adds and
  subtracts and writes them to special registers 0x10-0x15 (B = 0x1c, E = 0x10-0x15, words 0x123f-0x124a), where the clip
  hardware turns their signs into the clip codes the clippers read back from register 0x0d. The first word, at 0x1218,
  is a conditional call on `cc` 0x72 that recomputes the composite matrix when the modelview or projection changed.
- `umo_ObjToClipSpace`: **inferred**, second name the label table gives the code at 0x1218 (`uxform.s` line 44), so it
  takes a pair of object positions as input, multiplies them by the composite matrix 0x4f-0x5e and returns the same result: clip coordinates in
  record words 0x17-0x1a and six frustum distances in special registers 0x10-0x15.
- `lXF1` (`uxform.s` lines 52-97): **inferred**, the loop body of `mmo_ObjToClipSpace`, entered at 0x121f after a
  seven-word prologue. Each pass consumes two vertex records, runs 32 multiplies of their x, y, z and w inputs against the
  composite matrix, stores the clip-space output for both, and computes the w-relative plane distances. The relative transfer
  at 0x1242 (immediate -0x23) returns to it; the group-31 transfer at 0x1243 ends the command after the last pair.
- `mmo_ObjToClipSpaceN2E` (`uxform.s` lines 104-176): **inferred**, the clip transform for lit vertices. Besides the
  position transform of `mmo_ObjToClipSpace` it takes the object normal (record words 8-0xa) and multiplies it by the 3 x 3
  upper-left block of the inverse modelview (engine words 0x1f-0x21, 0x23-0x25, 0x27-0x29, three words of each of the first
  three columns), storing the eye-space normal as output to record words 0xf-0x11. Its second word, at 0x124d, calls `mMatrixInverse` on
  `cc` 0x76 to rebuild that inverse first. The normal is not rescaled here.
- `umo_ObjToClipSpaceN2E`: **inferred**, the second label at 0x124c (`uxform.s` line 104): same words, so it also transforms
  input normals in words 8-0xa by the inverse-modelview block at 0x1f-0x29 into an eye-space result in words 0xf-0x11, besides
  producing clip coordinates and frustum distances for each position.
- `lXF2` (`uxform.s` lines 113-176): **inferred**, the two-vertex loop of the normal-transforming clip module, from 0x1254.
  Per pass it takes two normals and two positions as input, multiplies the normals by nine inverse-modelview words and the two positions by the sixteen composite words,
  stores the normal outputs at E = 0xf-0x11 and the clip outputs at E = 0x17-0x1a, then derives the six plane distances
  for special registers 0x10-0x15. It loops through the relative transfer at 0x1289.
- `mmo_ObjToClipSpaceN2EN` (`uxform.s` lines 183-291): **inferred**, the normal-transforming clip module with
  GL_NORMALIZE. After the same inverse-modelview product as `mmo_ObjToClipSpaceN2E`, it sums the squares of the three eye
  normal components, takes a reciprocal square root (the Newton-Raphson step 0x57 run twice per vertex, at 0x12de-0x12df and
  0x12ea-0x12eb) and multiplies each component by it, so the eye-space normal output it stores at record words 0xf-0x11 (through the
  trailing registers 3 and 4, words 0x12f2-0x12f8) has unit length.
- `umo_ObjToClipSpaceN2EN`: **inferred**, the label sharing 0x1293 with the normalising clip module (`uxform.s` line 183);
  its result is a unit eye-space normal, which it normalises in record words 0xf-0x11, computed from the input normal in words 8-0xa with a
  reciprocal square root, plus the clip-space position and the six frustum distances.
- `lXF3` (`uxform.s` lines 192-291): **inferred**, the loop of the normalising module, from 0x129b to the transfer at
  0x12f4. Each pass takes two positions and two normals, computes clip coordinates (stores at E = 0x17-0x1a), the frustum
  distances for special registers 0x10-0x15, the dot product n . n of each eye normal, and the scaled normal output.
- `mmo_ObjToEyeSpace` (`uxform.s` lines 558-598): **inferred**, the eye-space transform that lighting, fog and texture
  generation need. It takes object positions (record words 0-3) and multiplies them by the modelview at engine words
  0x2f-0x3e, sixteen multiplies per vertex, storing the eye-space x, y, z and w as output in record words 0x13-0x16. It does
  no clip arithmetic and touches no special register.
- `umo_ObjToEyeSpace`: **inferred**, alias at 0x12fe (`uxform.s` line 558) of the modelview-only module: input record words
  0-3, result in words 0x13-0x16; it computes each output component as a four-term sum of input components times modelview words 0x2f-0x3e.
- `lXF5` (`uxform.s` lines 565-598): **inferred**, the loop of the eye-space module at 0x1304: 32 multiply-adds per pass
  transform two input positions, the eye results are stored at offsets 0x13-0x16, and the transfer at 0x131b (immediate -0x17)
  repeats it.
- `mmo_ObjToEyeSpaceAndTwoUserTR` (`uxform.s` lines 605-661): **inferred**, the eye transform for the case of two
  enabled user clip planes. It computes the eye position from the modelview as `mmo_ObjToEyeSpace` does, then evaluates the
  plane equation of each plane, the dot product of the eye position (record words 0x13-0x16) with the plane's four words at
  0xa3-0xa6 and 0xa7-0xaa, and writes the two distance results to special registers 0x16 and 0x17 (stores at 0x1357-0x135a), the
  user-clip inputs the clip hardware reports in register 0x0e.
- `umo_ObjToEyeSpaceAndTwoUserTR`: **inferred**, second label at 0x1325 (`uxform.s` line 605). It takes the position in
  words 0-3 and yields two outputs per vertex besides the eye position: plane distances that it computes as four-term dot
  products against user plane words 0xa3-0xaa, sent to special registers 0x16-0x17.
- `lXF12` (`uxform.s` lines 612-661): **inferred**, the loop of the two-plane module at 0x132b; each pass transforms two input
  positions, reads their eye coordinates back through the trailing registers (A = 3 and 4, D = 0x13-0x16) and multiplies them
  by the eight plane words, whose sums are the plane-distance results; the relative transfer at 0x1352 closes it.
- `mmo_ObjToEyeSpaceAndSixUserTR` (`uxform.s` lines 668-757): **inferred**, the same eye transform with all six user
  clip planes. After the modelview product it evaluates six plane equations against the eye position, using plane words
  0xa3-0xba in order as the second operand of each dot product, and stores the six distance results to special
  registers 0x16-0x1b.
- `umo_ObjToEyeSpaceAndSixUserTR`: **inferred**, the u-name at 0x135c (`uxform.s` line 668) of the six-plane module: it
  consumes object positions, multiplies them into eye space with modelview words 0x2f-0x3e, and its plane-distance results
  for planes 0-5 go to special registers 0x16-0x1b.
- `lXF7` (`uxform.s` lines 675-757): **inferred**, the six-plane loop at 0x1362. Its 80 multiply-adds per pass are 32 for
  the two eye positions and 48 for twelve plane evaluations (six planes, two vertices, four terms each); the inputs are
  record words 0-3 and the plane words, the outputs record words 0x13-0x16 and special registers 0x16-0x1b.

## Matrix maintenance (umatrix.s)

- `uMatrixMultCCC` (`umatrix.s` lines 39-116): **inferred**, rebuilds the composite matrix the clip transforms use. It
  takes the projection (engine words 0x3f-0x4e) and copies it into the staging words, replacing the third row: each column's
  third element becomes the difference of its fourth and third elements times 0.5, computed by the float subtracts at
  0xe72-0xe75 (fourth element staged at E = 3, 7, 0xb, 0xf; third element read from 0x41, 0x45, 0x49, 0x4d) and the multiplies
  by the constant 0.5 loaded at 0xe71. It then multiplies that matrix by the modelview at 0x2f-0x3e (64 multiplies and
  multiply-adds, 0xe7f-0xea5) and stores the 16 results to 0x4f-0x5e, the input of every clip transform. It writes special
  register 0x29 (store at 0xe7e) and returns through a group-5 indirect transfer at 0xea7. The operand order of the subtract
  is unknown, so whether the rewritten clip z runs from w at the near plane to 0 at the far plane, or from -w to 0, stays open;
  either way the clip transforms produce a z that the frustum test compares against w and 0 rather than against w and -w.
- `mMatrixInverse` (`umatrix.s` lines 314-426): **inferred**, the inverse of the modelview's 3 x 3 block, for transforming
  normals. It copies the modelview words 0x2f-0x3e to a scratch block at engine address 0x8d2c (words 0xeeb-0xefa), computes
  the cofactors with paired multiplies and subtracts (0xefc-0xf28), sums a row of them times the matrix to get the
  determinant, takes its reciprocal (seed at 0xf31, Newton-Raphson step 0x4f at 0xf2f and 0xf37), and multiplies each
  cofactor by it. Address register 0xf is loaded with 0x1f at 0xf44 for the stores of the result, the block from 0x1f that
  the normal transforms read. It writes special register 0x2b (0xf32) and returns at 0xf4f.

## Perspective divide and viewport (uscreen2.s)

**Established** from the reads of `uscreen2.s` and the stores of `mgeb_ViewPort` (`glmodes.S`, 0xf41d and 0xf427): the viewport
transform keeps its scale and offset pairs in engine words 0x7e-0x83, x scale at 0x7e and offset at 0x7f, y at 0x80 and 0x81,
z at 0x82 and 0x83 (`uBackInvQ2DI` reads all six by immediate, 0x11c1-0x11df). The guard-band factors sit at 0x71-0x74.
Window coordinates go to vertex record words 0x23 (x), 0x24 (y) and 0x25 (z).

- `mmo_ToScreenSpace` (`uscreen2.s` lines 91-92, with `uBack` and `lSC1` after it): **inferred**, the perspective divide
  and viewport transform of the plain vertex path. Its first word subtracts with the flag-enable bit set on the clip-code
  special register 0x0d (C = 0x1b, F = 0xd at 0x10c9), and the next word branches on `cc` 0x21 to `uSecondChance` when a
  vertex fell outside the frustum. Otherwise it runs on into `uBack` and `lSC1`, which take the clip coordinates of each
  vertex (record words 0x17-0x1a) as input, compute 1/w from the reciprocal seed and Newton-Raphson steps, multiply x, y and
  z by the viewport scale and by 1/w, add the viewport offsets, and store the window x, y and z results to words 0x23-0x25.
- `umo_ToScreenSpace`: **inferred**, second label at 0x10c9 (`uscreen2.s` line 91), the same divide: its input is the clip
  position in words 0x17-0x1a and its output the window position in words 0x23-0x25; it scales each coordinate by 1/w and
  then by the viewport pair, or reroutes the vertex through the guard-band test first.
- `uSecondChance` (`uscreen2.s` line 66): **inferred**, the guard-band retest. Its one word at 0x10b8 writes the clip-code
  register 0x0d from a staging word; the loop `lSC2` after it takes the w input of each vertex, multiplies it by the
  guard-band factors at engine words 0x71-0x74, subtracts x (record word 0x17) or y (word 0x18), and writes the four results
  to special registers 0x10-0x13. A vertex outside the frustum sides but inside the guard band then needs no geometric clip,
  since the raster stage can scissor it.
- `lSC2` (`uscreen2.s` lines 69-84): **inferred**, the two-vertex loop of the guard-band retest from 0x10b9; it takes the w
  input of each vertex (record word 0x1a), multiplies it by the factors at 0x71 and 0x72, subtracts x into special registers
  0x10 and 0x11, and repeats through the relative transfer at 0x10c0 (immediate -7). Its last words compute the y results for
  0x12 and 0x13 and jump to `uBack` at 0x10c1.
- `uBack` (`uscreen2.s` lines 94-102): **inferred**, the set-up of the divide, reached from both the direct and the
  guard-band path at 0x10cb. It loads the vertex pointers (registers 1 and 2 from 0x10 and 0x11) and the pair count, takes the
  w inputs of the first pair, points address register 9 at the viewport words from 0x7f (0x10cf), and starts the reciprocal
  of w with two Newton-Raphson steps (0x10d2-0x10d3) whose result the loop multiplies into each coordinate.
- `lSC1` (`uscreen2.s` lines 104-149): **inferred**, the divide loop at 0x10d4 and its output tail. Each pass takes two
  clip positions, computes the reciprocal seed of each w (0x10d4-0x10d5) and refines it with the Newton-Raphson reciprocal
  step (0x10da-0x10df), multiplies x, y and z by it and by the viewport scales, adds the offsets, and stores window x and y to
  words 0x23 and 0x24 and z to word 0x25 through a minimum (0x10ea), which clamps the window depth from above. After the loop
  it writes 0x70000 to the raster-bus address 0x1f8 (0x10f0-0x10f1) and sends a run of words through address register 0x1e,
  the output window at 0xffff0000 (0x10f2-0x10ff), so the results leave the engine for the raster stage.
- `mmo_ToScreenSpaceInvQ` (`uscreen2.s` lines 183-184, with `uBackInvQ` and `lSC3`): **inferred**, the divide for
  textured vertices. Besides the window position it takes the texture coordinates s, t, r and q (record words 0xb-0xe) as
  input and multiplies them by the texture matrix (32 multiply-adds per pass at 0x1121-0x113c), computes 1/w and 1/q with the
  reciprocal steps, and stores the projected texture results to record words 0xf-0x12 (0x1165-0x116c) beside the window
  coordinates at 0x23-0x25.
- `umo_ToScreenSpaceInvQ`: **inferred**, the u-name of the textured divide at 0x1113 (`uscreen2.s` line 183); it consumes
  clip position and texture coordinates and yields window coordinates plus texture coordinates it scales by the reciprocal of
  q, after a branch on `cc` 0x21 to `uSecondChanceInvQ` for vertices outside the frustum.
- `uSecondChanceInvQ` (`uscreen2.s` lines 156-158): **inferred**, the entry of the guard-band retest of the textured
  divide: it stages the clip-code register 0x0d (read at 0x1101) and rewrites it (0x1102), then runs on into `lSC4`, which
  computes the same w-times-factor minus x or y distances as `uSecondChance` from the input w and the words at 0x71-0x74,
  with results in special registers 0x10-0x13.
- `lSC4` (`uscreen2.s` lines 161-176): **inferred**, the loop at 0x1103 of the textured guard-band retest: two vertices per
  pass, it multiplies the w input by the guard-band factor and subtracts the x coordinate, the two side results stored to
  special registers 0x10 and 0x11; after it, the y results go to 0x12 and 0x13 and the jump at 0x110b leads to `uBackInvQ`.
- `uBackInvQ` (`uscreen2.s` lines 186-197): **inferred**, the set-up of the textured divide at 0x1115. It loads the pair
  count and pointers, takes the w input of the first pair, and multiplies the texture-coordinate inputs (record word 0xb) by
  the first texture-matrix words 0x5f and 0x60 (0x111d-0x111f) to start the products whose results the loop `lSC3` completes and stores.
- `lSC3` (`uscreen2.s` lines 199-331): **inferred**, the textured divide loop at 0x1121 and its output tail. Per pass it
  multiplies two vertices' s, t, r and q inputs by the texture matrix, adds the words at 0x75-0x77 (0x1143-0x1147),
  computes reciprocals of w and q, and stores window x, y and clamped z to words 0x23-0x25 and the projected texture results
  to words 0xf-0x12. The relative transfer at 0x116a closes the loop; the tail sends 0x70000 to bus address 0x1f8 and the
  vertex words through address register 0x1e to the output (0x1193-0x11a2).
- `mmo_ToScreenSpaceInvQ2DI` (`uscreen2.s` lines 365-366, with `uBackInvQ2DI` and `lSC5`): **inferred**, the textured
  divide that reads the viewport by immediate address instead of through register 9: it multiplies the clip x, y and z inputs
  by the scales at 0x7e, 0x80 and 0x82 (0x11c1-0x11c5), adds the offsets at 0x7f, 0x81 and 0x83 (0x11db-0x11df), and stores
  the window results to words 0x23-0x25, with the texture results to words 0xf-0x12 (0x11e1-0x11e6).
- `umo_ToScreenSpaceInvQ2DI`: **inferred**, alias at 0x11b6 (`uscreen2.s` line 365). It converts the clip position into
  window coordinates with the six viewport words 0x7e-0x83 as operands and the reciprocal of w, and returns texture
  coordinates divided by q, branching on `cc` 0x21 to its own guard-band retest.
- `uSecondChanceInvQ2DI` (`uscreen2.s` lines 338-340): **inferred**, the entry of the guard-band retest for the
  immediate-address divide; with `lSC6` after it, it takes w and x or y as input, multiplies w by the factors at 0x71-0x74 and
  subtracts the coordinate, and writes the results to special registers 0x10-0x13 before the jump to `uBackInvQ2DI` at
  0x11ae.
- `lSC6` (`uscreen2.s` lines 343-358): **inferred**, the loop at 0x11a6 of that retest; it takes two vertices' w and x as
  input, multiplies and subtracts to produce the left and right guard-band distances as results in special registers 0x10 and
  0x11, and repeats through the relative transfer at 0x11ad.
- `uBackInvQ2DI` (`uscreen2.s` lines 368-376): **inferred**, the set-up at 0x11b8. It copies the inputs at engine words
  0xbb and 0xbc into staging words 3 and 4 and points address register 0xa at the texture matrix 0x5f (0x11bb), so that `lSC5`
  multiplies texture coordinates by it and combine them with the reciprocal of q into the results it stores at words
  0xf-0x12.
- `lSC5` (`uscreen2.s` lines 378-467): **inferred**, the loop at 0x11c1 and its tail: the clip x, y and z inputs multiplied
  by the viewport scales 0x7e, 0x80 and 0x82 and by 1/w (seed at 0x11c5), offsets 0x7f and 0x81 added, depth combined with
  0x83 through a minimum, results stored to words 0x23-0x25; the transfer at 0x11e2 (immediate -0x21) repeats it, and the tail
  sends the vertex words through address register 0x1e (0x1208-0x1217).
