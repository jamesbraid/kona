# What the geometry-engine routines compute

The per-label catalogue in [ge_handlers.md](ge_handlers.md) says where each label sits, what reaches it and which operations its words use. This page goes one step further for the routines an emulator needs first: what each one takes in, what it writes out and the arithmetic between them. Every entry was written after reading the routine's words in [ge_listing/](ge_listing/) (`ge.u`, IRIX 6.5.30m) with the operation codes of [ge_ops.md](ge_ops.md) and the field readings of [ge_isa.md](ge_isa.md).

Facts are labelled **established** (read from the words at the addresses given) or **inferred** (with the reasoning). The operation of a word is established when its code is one the diagnostic test fixes; how the two arithmetic units route their register operands (the decoded groups `r148`, `r128` and `r110`) is not mapped, so the order of terms inside a sum, and which partial sum a word extends, come from the memory addresses and offsets the words name, not from a register trace.

## Engine memory the transform code shares

**Established** from the stores of the load-matrix handlers (form-14 and form-5 words with `r211` = 3 and `r95` = 4, an immediate address, in `matrixfunc.S`) and from the form-5 reads with C = 0x1b and `r95` = 0x13 in the transform modules:

| Words | Contents | Writer |
|---|---|---|
| 0x1f-0x2e | inverse of the modelview, for normals | `mMatrixInverse` |
| 0x2f-0x3e | modelview matrix, 16 words in the order the host sends them | `mgeb_LoadMatrix_Modelview` (operand words 0-15) |
| 0x3f-0x4e | projection matrix | `mgeb_LoadMatrix_Projection` |
| 0x4f-0x5e | composite object-to-clip matrix | `uMatrixMultCCC` |
| 0x5f-0x6e | texture matrix | `mgeb_LoadMatrix_Texture` |
| 0xa3-0xba | six user clip planes in eye space, four words each | the clip-plane handler |
| 0x190-0x19f | colour matrix | `mgeb_LoadMatrix_Color` |

**Inferred:** the host sends a GL matrix column by column, so word 4j + i of each block is row i of column j. Every matrix handler also stores to special register 0x29 or 0x2b (B = 0x1c, E = 0x29 or 0x2b), and the transform modules start with conditional calls on `cc` 0x72 and 0x76 to the routines that rebuild the composite and the inverse: those two registers are the dirty flags the conditions test.

## Vertex records and the transform loop

**Established** from the words of `uxform.s`. Every transform module handles two vertices per pass. Address register 1 and 2 point at the two vertex records (loaded from registers 0x10 and 0x11 in the prologue), registers 3 and 4 trail them by one pass (copied from 1 and 2 halfway through the loop), and register 0x13 is added to registers 1 and 2 at the end of a pass to step both to the next pair. Register 0 is loaded from register 0x19 and stepped by F = 0x25, and the relative transfer at the end of the loop body (`cc` 0x11, condition group 7) repeats while it has not run out. Words of a vertex record, as the transform code reads and writes them through those registers:

| Offset | Contents |
|---|---|
| 0-3 | object position x, y, z, w (input) |
| 8-0xa | object normal (input) |
| 0xf-0x11 | eye-space normal (output of the normal transforms) |
| 0x13-0x16 | eye-space position (output of the eye transforms) |
| 0x17-0x1a | clip-space x, y, z, w (output of the clip transforms) |

## Transform modules (uxform.s)

- `mmo_ObjToClipSpace` (`uxform.s` lines 44-97): **inferred**, the plain vertex transform
  of the fixed-function path. It takes object positions (record words 0-3, two vertices per pass) and multiplies each by the
  composite matrix at engine words 0x4f-0x5e, four multiplies per input component, summed in two partial chains that the four
  plain adds at 0x123b-0x123e combine. The results are the clip-space x, y, z and w, stored back into the record at offsets
  0x17-0x1a. It then computes the six frustum distances w + x, w - x, w + y, w - y, w + z and w - z with unit-1 float adds and
  subtracts and writes them to special registers 0x10-0x15 (B = 0x1c, E = 0x10-0x15, words 0x123f-0x124a), where the clip
  hardware turns their signs into the clip codes the clippers read back from register 0x0d. The first word, at 0x1218,
  is a conditional call on `cc` 0x72 that recomputes the composite matrix when the modelview or projection changed.
- `umo_ObjToClipSpace`: **inferred**, second name the label table gives the code at 0x1218 (`uxform.s` line 44), so it
  takes a pair of object positions as input, multiplies them by the composite matrix 0x4f-0x5e and returns the same result: clip coordinates in
  record words 0x17-0x1a and six frustum distances in special registers 0x10-0x15.
- `lXF1` (`uxform.s` lines 52-95): **inferred**, the loop body of `mmo_ObjToClipSpace`, entered at 0x121f after a
  seven-word prologue. Each pass consumes two vertex records, runs 32 multiplies of their x, y, z and w inputs against the
  composite matrix, stores the clip-space output for both, and computes the w-relative plane distances. The relative transfer
  at 0x1242 (immediate -0x23) returns to it; the group-31 transfer at 0x1243 ends the command after the last pair.
- `mmo_ObjToClipSpaceN2E` (`uxform.s` lines 104-176): **inferred**, the clip transform for lit vertices. Besides the
  position transform of `mmo_ObjToClipSpace` it takes the object normal (record words 8-0xa) and multiplies it by the 3 x 3
  upper-left block of the inverse modelview (engine words 0x1f-0x21, 0x23-0x25, 0x27-0x29, three words of each of the first
  three columns), storing the eye-space normal as output to record words 0xf-0x11. Its second word, at 0x124d, calls `mMatrixInverse` on
  `cc` 0x76 to rebuild that inverse first. The normal is not rescaled here.
- `umo_ObjToClipSpaceN2E`: **inferred**, the second label at 0x124c (`uxform.s` line 104): same words, so it also transforms
  input normals in words 8-0xa by the inverse-modelview block at 0x1f-0x29 into an eye-space result in words 0xf-0x11, besides
  producing clip coordinates and frustum distances for each position.
- `lXF2` (`uxform.s` lines 113-174): **inferred**, the two-vertex loop of the normal-transforming clip module, from 0x1254.
  Per pass it takes two normals and two positions as input, multiplies the normals by nine inverse-modelview words and the two positions by the sixteen composite words,
  stores the normal outputs at E = 0xf-0x11 and the clip outputs at E = 0x17-0x1a, then derives the six plane distances
  for special registers 0x10-0x15. It loops through the relative transfer at 0x1289.
- `mmo_ObjToClipSpaceN2EN` (`uxform.s` lines 183-291): **inferred**, the normal-transforming clip module with
  GL_NORMALIZE. After the same inverse-modelview product as `mmo_ObjToClipSpaceN2E`, it sums the squares of the three eye
  normal components, takes a reciprocal square root (the Newton-Raphson step 0x57 run twice per vertex, at 0x12de-0x12df and
  0x12ea-0x12eb) and multiplies each component by it, so the eye-space normal output it stores at record words 0xf-0x11 (through the
  trailing registers 3 and 4, words 0x12f2-0x12f8) has unit length.
- `umo_ObjToClipSpaceN2EN`: **inferred**, the label sharing 0x1293 with the normalising clip module (`uxform.s` line 183);
  its result is a unit eye-space normal, which it normalises in record words 0xf-0x11, computed from the input normal in words 8-0xa with a
  reciprocal square root, plus the clip-space position and the six frustum distances.
- `lXF3` (`uxform.s` lines 192-285): **inferred**, the loop of the normalising module, from 0x129b to the transfer at
  0x12f4. Each pass takes two positions and two normals, computes clip coordinates (stores at E = 0x17-0x1a), the frustum
  distances for special registers 0x10-0x15, the dot product n . n of each eye normal, and the scaled normal output.
- `mmo_ObjToEyeSpace` (`uxform.s` lines 558-598): **inferred**, the eye-space transform that lighting, fog and texture
  generation need. It takes object positions (record words 0-3) and multiplies them by the modelview at engine words
  0x2f-0x3e, sixteen multiplies per vertex, storing the eye-space x, y, z and w as output in record words 0x13-0x16. It does
  no clip arithmetic and touches no special register.
- `umo_ObjToEyeSpace`: **inferred**, alias at 0x12fe (`uxform.s` line 558) of the modelview-only module: input record words
  0-3, result in words 0x13-0x16; it computes each output component as a four-term sum of input components times modelview words 0x2f-0x3e.
- `lXF5` (`uxform.s` lines 565-596): **inferred**, the loop of the eye-space module at 0x1304: 32 multiply-adds per pass
  transform two input positions, the eye results are stored at offsets 0x13-0x16, and the transfer at 0x131b (immediate -0x17)
  repeats it.
- `mmo_ObjToEyeSpaceAndTwoUserTR` (`uxform.s` lines 605-661): **inferred**, the eye transform for the case of two
  enabled user clip planes. It computes the eye position from the modelview as `mmo_ObjToEyeSpace` does, then evaluates the
  plane equation of each plane, the dot product of the eye position (record words 0x13-0x16) with the plane's four words at
  0xa3-0xa6 and 0xa7-0xaa, and writes the two distance results to special registers 0x16 and 0x17 (stores at 0x1357-0x135a), the
  user-clip inputs the clip hardware reports in register 0x0e.
- `umo_ObjToEyeSpaceAndTwoUserTR`: **inferred**, second label at 0x1325 (`uxform.s` line 605). It takes the position in
  words 0-3 and yields two outputs per vertex besides the eye position: plane distances that it computes as four-term dot
  products against user plane words 0xa3-0xaa, sent to special registers 0x16-0x17.
- `lXF12` (`uxform.s` lines 612-659): **inferred**, the loop of the two-plane module at 0x132b; each pass transforms two input
  positions, reads their eye coordinates back through the trailing registers (A = 3 and 4, D = 0x13-0x16) and multiplies them
  by the eight plane words, whose sums are the plane-distance results; the relative transfer at 0x1352 closes it.
- `mmo_ObjToEyeSpaceAndSixUserTR` (`uxform.s` lines 668-750): **inferred**, the same eye transform with all six user
  clip planes. After the modelview product it evaluates six plane equations against the eye position, using plane words
  0xa3-0xba in order as the second operand of each dot product, and stores the six distance results to special
  registers 0x16-0x1b.
- `umo_ObjToEyeSpaceAndSixUserTR`: **inferred**, the u-name at 0x135c (`uxform.s` line 668) of the six-plane module: it
  consumes object positions, multiplies them into eye space with modelview words 0x2f-0x3e, and its plane-distance results
  for planes 0-5 go to special registers 0x16-0x1b.
- `lXF7` (`uxform.s` lines 675-748): **inferred**, the six-plane loop at 0x1362. Its 80 multiply-adds per pass are 32 for
  the two eye positions and 48 for twelve plane evaluations (six planes, two vertices, four terms each); the inputs are
  record words 0-3 and the plane words, the outputs record words 0x13-0x16 and special registers 0x16-0x1b.

## Matrix maintenance (umatrix.s)

- `uMatrixMultCCC` (`umatrix.s` lines 39-116): **inferred**, rebuilds the composite matrix the clip transforms use. It
  takes the projection (engine words 0x3f-0x4e) and copies it into the staging words, replacing the third row: each column's
  third element becomes the difference of its fourth and third elements times 0.5, computed by the float subtracts at
  0xe72-0xe75 (fourth element staged at E = 3, 7, 0xb, 0xf; third element read from 0x41, 0x45, 0x49, 0x4d) and the multiplies
  by the constant 0.5 loaded at 0xe71. It then multiplies that matrix by the modelview at 0x2f-0x3e (64 multiplies and
  multiply-adds, 0xe7f-0xea5) and stores the 16 results to 0x4f-0x5e, the input of every clip transform. It writes special
  register 0x29 (store at 0xe7e) and returns through a group-5 indirect transfer at 0xea7. The operand order of the subtract
  is unknown, so whether the rewritten clip z runs from w at the near plane to 0 at the far plane, or from -w to 0, stays open;
  either way the clip transforms produce a z that the frustum test compares against w and 0 rather than against w and -w.
- `mMatrixInverse` (`umatrix.s` lines 314-426): **inferred**, the inverse of the modelview's 3 x 3 block, for transforming
  normals. It copies the modelview words 0x2f-0x3e to a scratch block at engine address 0x8d2c (words 0xeeb-0xefa), computes
  the cofactors with paired multiplies and subtracts (0xefc-0xf28), sums a row of them times the matrix to get the
  determinant, takes its reciprocal (seed at 0xf31, Newton-Raphson step 0x4f at 0xf2f and 0xf37), and multiplies each
  cofactor by it. Address register 0xf is loaded with 0x1f at 0xf44 for the stores of the result, the block from 0x1f that
  the normal transforms read. It writes special register 0x2b (0xf32) and returns at 0xf4f.
